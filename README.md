# Introduction
Genome assembly is the process of piecing together fragmented sequencing data into a single biological sequence which is a prerequisite for meaningful genomic analysis. Despite the accessibility of modern sequencing platforms, the production of accurate, gap-free genomes remains a complex task. The quality of these assemblies directly impacts the reliability of downstream investigations, particularly in comparative genomics and the detection of genetic markers associated with pathogenicity and drug resistance (Whibley et al., 2021). 
The objective of this assignment is to assemble the genome of Salmonella enterica using long-read sequencing data generated by an Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platform and to compare the resulting consensus genome to a reference genome obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 
Salmonella enterica is a clinically and epidemiologically important bacterial species responsible for a wide range of foodborne illnesses worldwide. Precise genomic reconstruction allows for the detection of minute strain-level variations, which is fundamental for accurate source attribution and the phylogenetic tracking of outbreaks (Pightling et al., 2018). 
The primary advantage of long-read sequencing is its ability to resolve complex genomic repeats by anchoring them to unique flanking sequences. In bacterial genomics, achieving a complete, single-contig assembly usually requires reads that exceed 8kb. This length is critical because it allows the sequencer to bridge the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) operons, which are generally the largest identical repetitive regions found in bacteria (Cock et al., 2009). To address the limitations of short-read platforms, the field has shifted toward 'third-generation' technologies specifically engineered to generate substantially longer sequencing reads (Marx, 2023).
This requirement is currently best met by Oxford Nanopore's R10 flow cells, which combine the continuity of ultra-long reads with high-fidelity base-calling (Q20+). This combination effectively removes the need for short-read error correction, streamlining the assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes like Salmonella (Senol Cali et al., 2019). 
Despite these advantages, Nanopore sequencing also presents important challenges including sequencing errors particularly in homopolymer regions as well as balancing contiguity and correctness (Wick et al., 2019). These errors can lead to insertions, deletions, or mismatches in the assembled genome if not properly addressed. Consequently, genome assembly using Nanopore data requires specialized algorithms that are robust to noisy reads, as well as post-assembly polishing steps to improve base-level accuracy. These limitations highlight the importance of combining de novo assembly with reference-based analysis to obtain a more complete and accurate representation of the genome.
## method comparison
Generating accurate de novo assemblies from long-read platforms requires appropriate software. The choice of analysis tools is the primary determinant of the final output's quality, influencing everything from the quality, contiguity, and biological accuracy of the resulting genomes. For long-read bacterial genome assembly using Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) data, assemblers such as Flye, Canu, Shasta, and Raven are commonly used (Kolmogorov et al., 2019). In a study conducted by Cosma et al. (2023), Flye was the assembler that scored consistently good in most evaluation categories for assemblies of reads in ONT data. According to a study conducted in 2025 by (Kumar et al., 2025), it was concluded that when maximizing the length of contiguous fragments, tools such as NextDenovo and NECAT are often the top performers. In contrast, Flye is frequently recommended for its ability to strike a balance between computational speed and base-level accuracy. While Canu remains a powerful option for deep, correction-intensive assembly. Unicycler is distinctively noted for its ability to resolve circular chromosomes.
# proposed methods
## Data preprocessing and Quality Assessment
Raw sequencing reads will be provided in FASTQ format, generated using Oxford Nanopore R10 chemistry with an expected read accuracy of Q20+ and an N50 read length between 5–15 kb. Initial quality assessment will be performed using tools such as NanoPlot (v1.40) to evaluate read length distribution, quality scores, and overall data suitability for assembly (De Coster and Rademakers, 2023). 
## Genome Assembly
De novo genome assembly will be carried out using Flye (v2.9.3), a long-read assembler optimized for noisy sequencing data, including Oxford Nanopore reads. Flye employs a repeat graph–based strategy that has been shown to perform well for bacterial genome assembly by resolving repetitive regions and producing highly contiguous assemblies (Wick and Holt, 2021) 
## Assembly Polishing
To improve base-level accuracy, the assembled genome will be polished using Medaka, a neural-network–based polishing tool designed specifically for Oxford Nanopore data (Sereika et al., 2022). Polishing will involve re-aligning the original reads to the assembled contigs using Minimap2 (v2.24) and generating a refined consensus sequence.
## Genome Alignment and Variant Calling
The polished assembly will be aligned to the reference genome using Minimap2 (v2.24), which is optimized for long-read and assembly-to-reference alignments (Jain et al., 2020). Variant calling will be performed using tools such as bcftools to identify SNVs and small indels. Structural variations may be assessed using long-read–aware variant callers if necessary (Danecek et al., 2021).
## Visualization
Genome alignments and identified variants will be visualized using IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) (v2.18) (Robinson et al., 2023)
